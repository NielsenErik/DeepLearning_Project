*TRAINING*
- Train also with data augmentation (for example resize, crop, rotate, blur, grayscale images) - DONE
- Apply batch normalization in bottleneck - DONE
- Learning rate exponential (?) - DONE
- Get a validation set to continue monitor during training
- Save & Reload - DONE

*EVALUATION*
1) Localization precision:
    - IoU: using final program, label images, predict bounding box, compute IoU
2) Grounding accuracy:
    - Recall: in the test step, evaluate how much TP and FN and compute recall (TP/(TP+FN))
3) Semantic similarity:
    - Cosine similarity: using final program, compute an average of cosine similarities
