# DeepLearning_Project
## Introduction
This repository is the collection of all the material required, delveloped and produce to build the project of the Deep Learning course at University of Trento 2023.
The project was developed by [Manuel Righele](https://github.com/jvj00) and [Erik Nielsen](https://github.com/NielsenErik).
The main of the project is to fine-tune a neural network in order to perform a visual grounding task.
All the specifications of the assignment can be read on the [assignment's instructions](https://github.com/NielsenErik/DeepLearning_Project/blob/main/Docs/Deep%20Learning%202023%20-%20Assignment.pdf )
## Demo
